Potential power ups:
	- switch room hazards to boons
	- better handling
	- able to fire through locks / only wake monsters behind locks after the lock is destroyed
	- repulsor field that is used once per loop

TODO:
	- options menu
	- UI sound effects
	- credits & thanks
	- highscore & track current score
	- other enemies
	- animate throwing the scythe
	- add to enemies both "erratic" and "dodge" move menchanics
	- flag on rooms that allow them to close the retreat door when a player walks through
	- add "platform" mechanics to a new room type
	- juice up the power-up selection

Bugs:
	- fix lock being left in a wall when paths move
	- scythes not spawning when ghost is close?
