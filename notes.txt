Potential power ups:
	- only wake monsters behind locks after the lock is destroyed
	- repulsor field that is used once per loop
	- switch room hazards to boons

TODO:
	- add states when map is being mutated where we first pan the camera out to see entire map, then pan the camera back in
	- add sounds for sword throwing room
	- monsters can't travel faster than current player max?
	- Make ghosts primary colors only (pure red, pure blue) - although might be good to have blue switch to white after t-port and then power back to blue as recharges
	- give t-port ghosts 10 different possible locations, and have them pick the one that's the same distance from the player, but farthest from the dagger
	- Add new "slow" ghost that slows you down in an area, maybe they're green?
	- add crenelated room
	- add arena room (vometorium near entrances, blockers around non-entrances)
	- Have only two monster power-ups per room
	- Color keys should stay completely consistant as waves advance
	- add GitHub URL to credits page
	- better point blank ghost movement
	- UI sound effects
	- highscore & track current score
	- other enemies
	- animate throwing the scythe
	- flag on rooms that allow them to close the retreat door when a player walks through
	- add "platform" mechanics to a new room type
	- juice up the power-up selection

Bugs:
	- fix lock being left in a wall when paths move
	- scythes not spawning when ghost is close?
