TODO:
	- monsters can't travel faster than current player max?
	- give t-port ghosts 10 different possible locations, and have them pick the one that's the same distance from the player, but farthest from the dagger
	- Add new "slow" ghost that slows you down in an area, maybe they're green? Maybe instead it's a ghost that adds a locked door to the room if the player and the ghost are in the same room
	- Have only two monster power-ups per room
	- add GitHub URL to credits page
	- better point blank ghost movement
	- UI sound effects
	- highscore & track current score
	- other enemies
	- animate throwing the scythe
	- flag on rooms that allow them to close the retreat door when a player walks through
	- add "platform" mechanics to a new room type
	- juice up the power-up selection
	- add artwork to replace the "white tiles" of the exit room
	- make fire pit resistance more meaningful
	- if a mutation can't be slotted, make sure it's random roll continues to climb until it can be slotted (although some mutations should start at a lower roll)

Bugs:
	- scythes not spawning when ghost is close?

Potential power ups:
	- repulsor field that is used once per loop
	- switch room hazards to boons
	- more weapon upgrade variations

Jam Feedback:
	- better counters for the teleporting ghosts
	- maybe give ghosts more HP and let the hero fire faster? Gives the player more agency
	- different enemies
	- more animation
	- fancier textures
